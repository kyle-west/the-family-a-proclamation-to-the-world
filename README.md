# THE FAMILY: A PROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD Test

This is a practice test generator for the [FDREL 200](https://content.byui.edu/file/57968560-ab2b-4795-a911-45e78f9c62e3/12/fdrel200Syllabus.html)
course at Brigham Young University-Idaho. In that class, all students are required to memorize the entire
[The Family: a Proclamation to the World](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation) document verbatim. 

This web application is made to help the students in this endevor. Good luck my 
friends, I hope this helps. 

## Running locally

First, clone the repo to your machine.

```sh
cd ~ # or where ever you want to install it
git clone https://github.com/kyle-west/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world.git
```

Next [install Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure that the `http`
module is installed.

Finally, run `server` to run on [localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000/), or `server [PORT]`
to change the port you are running on. 

Of course, since these are all just static files, you could always use the `file:///` protocol
in your browser if you don't want to boot up the server.
